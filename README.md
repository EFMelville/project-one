# project-one
First project for bootcamp

The decision to use Tennessee as the state from which to gather data was determined by the information on this map: https://atlasofsurveillance.org/atlas.
The map shows Tennesse as being the state which makes the most extensive use of the technology.

The crime data was gathered from:https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend by searching for Tennesse and the years 2018,2020, and 2022. 

The many .csv files were sifted through to determine useful and relevant data. The data was then cleaned and organized for analysis. Once the data was readable graphs and charts were created to visualize the information.

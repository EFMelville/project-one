The decision to use Tennessee as the state from which to gather data was determined by the information on this map: https://atlasofsurveillance.org/atlas.
The map shows Tennesse as being the state which makes the most extensive use of the technology.

The crime data was gathered from:https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend by searching for Tennesse and the years 2018,2020, and 2022. 

The many .csv files were sifted through to determine useful and relevant data. The data was then cleaned and organized for analysis. Once the data was readable graphs and charts were created to visualize the information.

IN SUMMARY:

According to the data collected on the amount of reported crimes within the state of Tennessee over the years dating from before predictive policing was established (2015) to several years after establishment (2022), after analysis, we can see a consistent trend in reported criminal activity. After a spike in reports in the year 2018, there is a continuous reduction in a majority of crime activity. 

Although, with much work yet to be done, we can see that predictive policing appears to have helped reduce crime rates. 

The type of crime most affected by predictive policing is assault offenses, burglary, drug/narcotic offenses, and destruction/vandalism.

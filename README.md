# project-one
First project for bootcamp

The decision to use Tennesse as the state from which to gather data was determined by the information on this map: https://atlasofsurveillance.org/atlas.
The map shows Tennesse as being the state which makes the most extensive use of the technology.

The crime data was gathered from:https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend by searching for Tennesse and the years 2018,2020, and 2022.
